Instructions:

1. Make seperate folders for each release of the factory image archive, and keep only one archive in the directory. The script will otherwise extract all zip files inside the directory it was executed in, and act only on the first extraction.

2. Either add the script to a directory in your path, or move the script to the directory of your archived factory images and execute from there. Check environment variables with echo $PATH.

3. Follow prompts.

4. Move on with your life.
